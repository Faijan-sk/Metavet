        Fleas and ticks can cause serious health problems for your pet. Fleas
        can lead to flea allergy dermatitis, causing itching, sores, and hair
        loss. They can also carry tapeworm eggs, which can infect your pet if
        ingested. Advanced stages of flea infestations can lead to anemia, if
        you suspect your pet is anemic due to fleas, this is an emergency.

        Ticks spread bacteria that cause diseases like Lyme disease, Rocky
        Mountain spotted fever, and zoonosis. Lyme disease can make your pet
        tired, cause joint pain, and reduce their appetite. Rocky Mountain
        spotted fever can lead to skin sores, vomiting, and nervous system
        issues. Zoonosis causes symptoms like diarrhea, fever, and runny eyes.
