            Doctors of Veterinary Medicine and Veterinary Surgeons are medical
            professionals whose primary responsibility is protecting the health
            and welfare of animals and people. The term "veterinarian" comes
            from veterinae, which means "working animals." Every veterinarian
            has gone through extensive medical training to be prepared for this
            responsibility.

            Veterinarians employ state-of-the-art technology that is very
            similar to technology used in the treatment of humans. Veterinarians
            in private clinical practice work to prevent disease and other
            health problems in their patients. They examine animal patients,
            vaccinate them against diseases, and work to prevent other illnesses
            and conditions.
