      <p className="mb-4">
        Thousands of homeless, helpless animals are euthanized every year in
        shelters across North America. Spaying and neutering your animals can
        have a positive impact on the health & quality of their lives. Spaying
        (for females) & Neutering (for males) are common surgical procedures
        that prevent pets from reproducing.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Key Benefits:</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Prevents unwanted litters:</strong> Spaying and neutering help
          control the pet population by preventing accidental pregnancies &
          reducing the number of animals in shelters.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Spaying can prevent uterine
          infections & breast cancer in females, while neutering lowers the risk
          of testicular cancer and prostate problems in males.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Behavioral Improvements:</strong> Neutering male pets can
          reduce behaviors like marking territory, roaming & aggression. Spaying
          females can help avoid heat cycles and the behaviors associated with
          them, like excessive vocalization and restlessness.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Longer Lifespan:</strong> Spayed & neutered pets tend to live
          longer, healthier lives by avoiding certain health risks and
          preventing bad behavior that can lead to accidents or injuries.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Cost Effective:</strong> The cost of spaying or neutering is
          typically lower than the expenses associated with caring for a litter
          of puppies, kittens, or other small mammals, as well as treating
          reproductive health issues later.
