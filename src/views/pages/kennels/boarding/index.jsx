      <p className="mb-4">
        Pet boarding is a service that provides temporary care for pets while
        their owners are away. It typically involves a pet staying at a
        facility, such as a kennel, pet hotel, or with a trusted caregiver,
        where they receive food, shelter, and supervision. Depending on the
        facility, additional services like exercise, grooming, and medical care
        may be offered. Pet boarding is ideal for when you need to travel or
        have a busy schedule and want to ensure your pet is well taken care of
        in a safe environment while you enjoy your trip.

        Tips for Choosing a Pet Boarding Service:

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Reputation & Reviews:</strong> Look for facilities with good
          reviews and recommendations from other pet owners.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safety and Security:</strong> Ensure the facility has proper
          enclosures, secure fencing & safety protocols in place to prevent
          escapes or accidents. Well-trained staff in pet first aid & emergency
          procedures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Facility Cleanliness:</strong> Assess cleanliness & hygiene

          illnesses.

          <strong>Staff to Pet Ratio:</strong> Ensure adequate staff to pet
          ratios.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medical Care & Special Needs:</strong> If your pet requires
          special medical needs, check to ensure the facility can administer
          medication, monitor health conditions, or provide that extra care.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exercise & Socialization:</strong> Are there separate areas
          for large & small breed animals? Specific timelines scheduled for
          exercise & socialization?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comfort & Accommodations:</strong> Separate facilities for
          canines & felines?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trial Stay:</strong> Consider a trial stay before a longer
          trip to see how your pet adjusts to the facility & staff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Daily Routine & Updates:</strong> Ensure the facility provides
          a daily service, updates & photos during your pet's stay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pricing & Policies:</strong> Understand the cost associated
          with boarding & what is included. Also, be aware of cancellation,
