        Blood tests are an essential part of diagnosing what is ailing your pet,
        just as they are in human medicine. Blood tests can tell the
        veterinarian a myriad of things, from dehydration to anemia.

        Common Blood Tests Used by Veterinarians
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Red blood cells are used to determine several factors. The packed red
        blood cell count can detect a condition called polycythemia. A high
        count indicates dehydration, while a low count can be an indicator of
        anemia. The hemoglobin concentration test measures the oxygen-carrying
        capacity of your petâ€™s blood, and the red blood cell count can tell your
        vet how well your pet's body is functioning. Testing white blood cells
        is equally as useful. A high white blood cell count is indicative of
        infection, whereas a low blood cell count can mean a weakened immune
        system.
