      <p className="mb-4">
        As pet parents, we all know that their health & wellness goes far beyond
        clinic visits & vaccines. Grooming is not a luxury, but is truly a key
        part of keeping your furry companion healthy, happy & of course
        beautiful. Keeping a regular grooming schedule contributes to overall
        pet health. Metavet can connect you with a skilled groomer who is
        perfectly suited to your pet's unique grooming requirements.
