        DID you know…. Dogs and cats can develop dental issues similar to
        humans, such as gingivitis, periodontal disease, tooth decay, and
        cavities. When your pet eats, food particles fuel bacteria that form
        plaque on their teeth. If left untreated, plaque hardens into tartar,
        leading to gum disease, cavities, and infections.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        When was the last time you had your pet’s teeth cleaned? AVMA states
        that pets who have NOT had a teeth cleaning by 3 years of age show signs
        of dental disease. For this reason, amongst many others, Metavet can
        connect you with professionals for oral examinations & dental cleanings.
