        Using telemedicine for your pet allows you to consult with a
        veterinarian from the comfort of your home. During the virtual visit,
        you can discuss your pet’s symptoms, ask questions, and receive guidance
        on care or treatment options. While telemedicine is ideal for
        non-emergency situations or follow-up care, your vet may recommend an
        in-person visit if a physical exam or more complex procedures are
        needed. It’s a convenient and efficient way to get professional advice
        without the hassle of travel.

        anywhere. Our goal is to provide easier, simpler access to veterinary

        Telemedicine will never replace the value of hands-on care by a
        professional & you still need to plan for an annual check in for
        parasite prevention, vaccines & general overall wellness of your
        animals. Metavet is dedicated to helping you connect quickly with a
        professional that best suits your needs.
