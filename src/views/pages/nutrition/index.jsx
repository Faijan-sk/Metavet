      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Dry Food (Kibble):</strong> Convenient and good for dental
          health, but it may not be suitable for all pets, especially those with
          certain medical conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wet Food (Canned):</strong> Great for pets who need extra
          moisture in their diet, especially older pets or those with urinary
          issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Raw Food:</strong> Some pet owners choose raw feeding, but
          it’s important to work with your vet to ensure that the raw diet is
          balanced and safe for your pet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prescription Diets:</strong> Special diets recommended for
          pets with medical conditions like kidney disease, food allergies, or
          obesity.
