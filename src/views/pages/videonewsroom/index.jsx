            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              Every day, Cindy Fleischner lines up her crew of cuddly canines
              for breakfast. As the four other dogs eat, Cindy pulls Katy, her
              12-year-old Shepherd mix aside for a peanut butter treat. Katy is
              battling lymphoma, and this treat hides her daily dose of
              chemotherapy drugs. Katy is not alone in this war. Canine cancer
              is one of the leading causes of dog deaths. Of the more than 100
              million dogs in North America, about two in four will develop
              cancer, and one in four will die from some form of this dreaded
              disease. In some purebred dogs, the percentages could be even
              higher.
              <br />
              <br />
              Adopted from the Denver Dumb Friends League, Katy was no stranger
              to hospitals. As a licensed Therapy Dog, she spent many hours at a
              local hospital, bringing comfort and joy to patients. However,
              Fleishner began to notice that Katy, a normally sweet dog, became
              distracted, and something was not right. A physical examination
              found a growing mass on Katy's throat. Further testing and surgery
              would determine that the lump was thyroid cancer.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP),
              43% of all dogs and 53% of all cats are classified as overweight.
              What's worse is that an additional 10% of all dogs and 19% of all
              cats are considered obese! Therefore, more than half of our dogs
              and cats are overweight or obese. So, should your pet start an
              Atkins Diet?

              Ramsey is a "cheese-aholic." At 6 years old and 156 lbs, this Bull
              Mastiff listens for his owner to unwrap the cellophane from a
              cheese slice and then makes a beeline for the refrigerator. Joyce
              Sternberg, Ramsey's owner, says originally cheese was an incentive
              to teach Ramsey to shut the back door. As a result, Ramsey had
              become so heavy he actually tried to avoid walks. Dislike for
              exercise is a common theme for overweight pets. Irene Snow was
              chided by her veterinarian for allowing her Malamute mix, Yogi
              Bear, to balloon up to 127 pounds. An overweight pet is more prone
              to heart problems, poor skin condition, lameness, and more serious
              illnesses, like diabetes. A groundbreaking study actually details
              how pets who free-feed live an average of two years less than pets
              with limited calories.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Pain Management in Pets</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              Arthritis and chronic pain are not purely human conditions. Dogs
              and cats feel pain too, and arthritis causes long-term pain that
              can affect their behavior and activity level. Modern veterinary
              diagnostics and therapies can offer some hope.
              <br />
              <br />
              Pain has many causes. When it happens to your pet friends, it's
              especially sad. It generates almost the same emotions in us as
              when our children hurt.
              <br />
              <br />
              Arthritis is even more common in dogs than it is in people. One
              out of every six people, or about 43 million, suffers with some
              form of arthritis. Compare that to dogs where about 20%, or one in
              five dogs, feel the pain of arthritis. This number almost doubles
              in dogs older than 7 years.
              <br />
              <br />
              This occurs as both people and dogs and cats grow older. The
              joints don't function as smoothly and lose some of their ability
              to lubricate joint movement as time passes. More than 15 million
              dogs in North America suffer some form of degenerative joint
              disease, better known as arthritis. Unfortunately, many dog owners
              are unaware of the pain their pet is experiencing, chalking up the
              slow movement to the effects of "old age."
              <br />
              <br />
              Some dogs may receive daily doses of pain relievers and oral joint
              care supplements. Still others might find their way to physical
              therapy or rehabilitation. Some lucky pets even get ramps built in
              their homes, sparing them the need to climb the dreaded stairs!
              But for some, any or all of these options are not enough to
              relieve the pain. But a potentially helpful treatment may be on
              the horizon called stem cell therapy. Vet-Stem, a company focused
              on bringing regenerative medicine technology to veterinarians, has
              developed a therapy to treat arthritis in dogs using the pet's own
              fat tissue!

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              The use of acupuncture is growing in popularity among
              veterinarians, and they are impressed with the results. Only a few
              decades ago, the use of acupuncture in veterinary medicine was
              virtually unheard of. In recent years, the use of acupuncture in
              veterinary medicine has been steadily growing, and success stories
              like Sampson are driving further interest in veterinary
              acupuncture. At a recent Western Veterinary Conference (the
              largest continuing educational conference for veterinarians in the
              world), an acupuncture wet lab was filled to capacity with
              veterinarians interested in learning more about this "alternative"
              therapy.
              <br />
              <br />
              As interest and application of acupuncture grow in veterinary
              medicine, practitioners are using the modality for much more than
              pain control. In fact, acupuncture can be used to help treat
              allergies, seizures, reproductive problems, and liver and kidney
              disease.

              The Cutting Edge... Laser Surgery for Pets!
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              It's doubtful that anyone would picture their family veterinarian
              swinging a lightsaber, but laser surgery is a reality. For more
              than 30 years, human doctors have used various types of surgical
              lasers to help people heal faster and with less pain. Lasers are
              now used routinely to help correct eyesight, remove skin
              blemishes, and even destroy unwanted hair. But it has only been
              within the past 10 years that veterinary medicine has started to
              utilize this same technology to provide a similar level of comfort
              for their patients.

              Breed Specific Rescue Groups
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              Many dog owners admire the unique looks and personalities of
              purebreds but also worry about the fate of millions of pets
              euthanized each year. What many people don't realize is that there
              are specific breed rescue organizations for almost every breed of
              dog, placing dogs in need in new homes. Dogs aren't the only lucky
              recipients of this type of attention! Purebred cat rescues exist,
              as well as rabbit rescues, horse groups, and even organizations
              devoted to rescuing exotic pets such as turtles and other
              reptiles.
              <br />
              <br />
              Rescue groups are an invaluable resource in the ongoing battle to
              keep millions of pets from being euthanized. With armies of
              volunteers, these organizations not only rescue their specific
              breed from shelters and other situations but also provide them
              with medical care. In many cases, these dogs are rescued just days
              - even hours - before euthanasia is scheduled.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              Winter is a time of cold weather festivals, holiday parties, and
              changing weather. For pets and pet owners, this season can bring
              its own unique set of challenges and hazards. Keeping your pet
              safe during this time of year will require some preparation and
              homework.
              <br />
              <br />
              Family gatherings and get-togethers can be a potential trial for
              pet owners. With so many strangers and so much food, many pets
              will take advantage of this situation to the fullest. Be sure to
              tell your party guests to avoid feeding the four-legged vacuum
              cleaner. Many of the traditional holiday foods can possibly be
              dangerous or even deadly to your pet. If your dog or cat will not
              behave, you may have to relegate them to their room for the
              duration of the festivity.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Traveling with Pets</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              According to a survey of pet owners by the American Animal
              Hospital Association (AAHA), more than 53% of dog and cats will
              travel with their owners. With the upcoming busy travel season,
              what are the best ways of traveling with your best friend?
              <br />
              <br />
              It has been said that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
              cure." For pet owners preparing to travel by plane or car, a few
              ounces of preparation and time will prevent future heartaches and
              frustrations on the trip. First, make sure that your pet has
              proper identification on him or her at all times. This can be
              something as simple as an ID tag on his collar, but a more
              permanent solution would be the use of an implantable microchip.
              Next, make sure you have copies of vaccination records and needed
              medications easily accessible during the trip. You might even ask
              your family veterinarian for a recommendation of an emergency
              hospital near your destination. And finally, do your homework.
              Some airlines and travel sites may require a health certificate
              for your pet. This document must be dated within 10 days of the
              start of your travels.
