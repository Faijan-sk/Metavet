        We understand that sometimes it’s not always possible to bring your
        animal into the clinic, whether due to time constraints, transportation
        issues, location, or for a simple check-up. That’s why we offer
        telemedicine consultation services, so you can get expert veterinary
        advice from the comfort of your own home.

        What is Teleconsultation?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Teleconsultation offers you the convenience of connecting with a
        veterinary professional 24/7 via video call, phone call, or live chat.
        This service is ideal for addressing minor health concerns, behavioral
        issues, or seeking general advice about your animal's well-being without
        having to leave your home.
      </p>

        When to Use Teleconsultation:
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Minor Health Concerns:</strong> If you are noticing a slight
          change in your pet’s behavior, appetite, or energy, teleconsultations
          can help assess the situation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Routine Advice:</strong> General health questions that are not
          answered in the Learning Library, vaccination schedules, or advice on
          behavior or nutrition & grooming.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Behavioral Issues:</strong> Discussing & treating issues like
          anxiety, barking, scratching, or other behavioral concerns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow-up Care:</strong> Ideal for post-surgery or ongoing
          care updates without the need to visit the clinic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prescription Management:</strong> For ongoing medication
          management, refills, or adjustments to prescriptions can be made
          without an in-person visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Remote or Underserved Areas:</strong> If you live in or are
          traveling through an underserved area, teleconsultations give you
          access to health services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergency Triage:</strong> If you are unsure whether a visit
          to the clinic is necessary, we can help assess the situation
          virtually.
        </li>
      </ul>
