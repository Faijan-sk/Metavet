        A petâ€™s behaviour can reveal a lot about their health & well-being.
        Changes in behaviour may indicate underlying health issues, stress,
        anxiety, or unmet needs. Addressing behavioural problems early can help
        prevent them from escalating. All pet owners encounter behavioural
        problems at some point, especially during different life stages or
        environmental changes.

          <strong>Destructive Chewing/Licking:</strong> Some pets chew

          <strong>Phobias & Fears:</strong> Fear of loud noises or certain
