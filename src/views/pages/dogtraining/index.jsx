        Key Advantages to Training:
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Improved Communication:</strong> Training helps establish
          clear communication between you and your pet, so they understand what
          is expected of them & can follow commands effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Better Behaviour:</strong> Trained pets tend to behave better,
          are more accustomed to responding to commands which helps minimize
          unwanted negative behaviours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stronger Bond:</strong> Training sessions provide quality time
          to bond with your pet. Positive reinforcement techniques, like treats
          & praise, build trust & strengthen the relationship.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safety:</strong> Basic commands like “sit”, “stay”, or “come”
          can be lifesaving in situations where you need to keep your pet safe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mental Stimulation:</strong> Training challenges the brain &
          provides a mental workout. Prevents boredom & destructive behaviour,
          essentials for high-energy or intelligent breeds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Socialization:</strong> Training exposes your pet to different
          environments, people & other animals, essential to social development.
          Well socialized animals are less likely to develop fear-based
          behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confidence:</strong> Well-trained pets know what to expect &
          tend to feel more secure and confident in their surroundings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Good Manners:</strong> A well-trained pet is generally more
          polite & respectful with both people & other animals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prevention of Behavioral Issues:</strong> Teaching your pet
          boundaries early on can prevent certain behavioural issues from
          arising or escalating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fun & Enjoyable:</strong> Training can be an enjoyable
          activity for all involved, it’s a great way to engage & have fun.
